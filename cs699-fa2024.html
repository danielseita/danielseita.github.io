        <b>Course Description</b>
        <p>
        This special topics class and seminar will cover state of the art
        advances in robot manipulation. This is about robots interacting with
        and affecting their environment, and could refer to things such as
        grasping, pushing, picking-and-placing, tossing, and many other actions.
        Aided in part by the rise of deep learning and subsequent advances in
        robot perception, the research area of robot manipulation has
        experienced tremendous growth in recent years. Nonetheless, despite this
        progress, real-world manipulation remains fundamentally hard. In this
        course, we will review and understand robot manipulation with a focus on
        using learning-based techniques. We will explore how to get such systems
        to work more reliably in unstructured real world settings.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        For Fall 2024, we will continue the "multimodality" theme from last
        fall, where we study robots that can handle multiple types of inputs or
        perform multiple types of actions. For example, this would include robot
        manipulation based on language and images as input. For 2024, we will
        also focus on higher-DOF control, including bimanual robots, quadrupeds
        with arms, and humanoid manipulation. We will also emphasize learning
        from human feedback.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        In this class, students will read, review, and present research papers.
        Most research papers will be recent and have cutting-edge results.
        Students will also work on a substantial final project.  This class is
        aimed at PhD students who are doing research in this topic. However,
        undergraduates and master's students can enroll with permission of the
        instructor. If interested, please talk to the instructor at the
        beginning of the semester.
        </p>

        <b>Learning Objectives</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>A better understanding of robot learning, and specifically robot learning for manipulation.</li>
          <li>Gain experience reading, understanding, analyzing, and debating papers from robotics venues.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Main conferences: CoRL, RSS, ICRA, IROS, ISRR, ISER, WAFR.</li>
            <li>Main journals: RA-L, T-RO, IJRR, AURO, Science Robotics.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Understand, implement, and experiment with state-of-the-art algorithms for the final project.</li>
          <li>Improve academic writing and presentation skills.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <b>Academic Integrity</b>
        <p>Discussing with other students at a high level is allowed, but you must write up your own paper reviews and write, prepare, and deliver your own class presentation. For final projects, you must also acknowledge whether this is ongoing and concurrent research (and to what extent you will be implementing or working on class-related material), and whether you are re-using materials for another class.</p>

        <p>You are welcome to use whatever resources you need to best learn the material. In general, we agree with <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/fa2022/integrity.html">Jeff Erickson's citation policy</a>. For example:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>If you talked with a robotic manipulation researcher to help understand a technical concept, you must acknowledge that person.</ul>
          <li>If you used someone else's blog post as a background reference, you must cite it.</ul>
          <li>Using Generative AI is encouraged, but you must tell us how you use it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide templates for assignments where you must acknowledge the ingredients you used for your assignment and/or project.</p>

        <b>Prerequisites</b>
        <p>Courses such as CSCI 467: Introduction to Machine Learning, and CSCI 545: Introduction to Robotics, are recommended but not required. Students are expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of robotics (especially manipulation) and machine learning, or be willing to learn the material as needed. This class will consist largely of reading and discussing papers, which requires some degree of technical maturity.</p>

        <b>Grading</b>
        <p>The overall course grade is based on:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Homework assignments: 10%</li>
          <li>Lab assignments: 30%</li>
          <li>Midterm exam: 30%</li>
          <li>Final exam: 30%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        We will share grades via Gradescope. We reserve the right to make tweaks to the grading as needed.
        When submitting assignments on Gradescope please follow the instructions carefully to make sure that the formatting is correct (e.g., if we ask for one page per answer, please do that).
        To encourage in-class attendance and productive discussions on Piazza, we may offer a small amount of extra credit points to students with excellent course participation or who have written exceptionally helpful or useful Piazza posts.
        In practice, this may help students who are just below the cutoff for a particular grade.
