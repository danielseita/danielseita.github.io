        <b>Course Description</b>
        <p>
        This special topics class and seminar will cover state of the art
        advances in robot manipulation. This is about robots interacting with
        and affecting their environment, and could refer to things such as
        grasping, pushing, picking-and-placing, tossing, and many other actions.
        Aided in part by the rise of deep learning and subsequent advances in
        robot perception, the research area of robot manipulation has
        experienced tremendous growth in recent years. Nonetheless, despite this
        progress, real-world manipulation remains fundamentally hard. In this
        course, we will review and understand robot manipulation with a focus on
        using learning-based techniques. We will explore how to get such systems
        to work more reliably in unstructured real world settings.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        For Fall 2024, we will continue the "multimodality" theme from last
        fall, where we study robots that can handle multiple types of inputs or
        perform multiple types of actions. For example, this would include robot
        manipulation based on language and images as input. For 2024, we will
        also focus on higher-DOF control, including bimanual robots, quadrupeds
        with arms, and humanoid manipulation. We will also emphasize learning
        from human feedback.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        In this class, students will read, review, and present research papers.
        Most research papers will be recent and have cutting-edge results.
        Students will also work on a substantial final project.  This class is
        aimed at PhD students who are doing research in this topic. However,
        undergraduates and master's students can enroll with permission of the
        instructor. If interested, please talk to the instructor at the
        beginning of the semester.

        <b>Weekly Schedule and Paper List</b>
        <p>Here is the weekly schedule and paper list:</p>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKmv1bkNQxRsvQ4lCfzR2_4hJIzxWg8Vvi1jG7sW8B0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKmv1bkNQxRsvQ4lCfzR2_4hJIzxWg8Vvi1jG7sW8B0/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <b>Guide to Course Materials</b>
        <p>See this document for more details about the presentations, paper reviews, scribe notes, and class final project:</p>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZ-JtT-dc22wAPNRUGpeYKemF68MXlcMV49iEFMy9xE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZ-JtT-dc22wAPNRUGpeYKemF68MXlcMV49iEFMy9xE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <b>Lecture and Class Structure</b>
        <p>See the spreadsheet above for the schedule. The first two lectures will provide background material. After the first two lectures, each 3+ hour class will involve presentations and discussions of research papers. The class will be structured (roughly) as follows:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>At the beginning, Daniel may talk briefly about recent robotics updates.</li>
            <li>Presentation of 3 related papers.</li>
            <li>A discussion / debate of those 3 papers.</li>
            <li>A break, because the class is 3 hours and 20 minutes long (let me know if you don't want one).</li>
            <li>Presentation of 3 more papers.</li>
            <li>A discussion / debate of those 3 papers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead of paper discussions, the final week will involve a summary
        of what we have learned, and final project presentations. Thus, besides
        the first and last parts of the class, most weeks will involve students
        learning from academic robot manipulation research papers. We will not
        record the lectures but the slides will be made publicly available.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <b>Prerequisites</b>
        <p>Courses such as CSCI 467: Introduction to Machine Learning, and CSCI 545: Introduction to Robotics, are recommended but not required. Students are expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of robotics (especially manipulation) and machine learning, or be willing to learn the material as needed. This class will consist largely of reading and discussing papers, which requires some degree of technical maturity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <b>Grading</b>
        <p>Your grade will be based on:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>25%: Class presentations</li>
            <li>25%: Paper reviews</li>
            <li>10%: Scribe notes</li>
            <li>05%: Class participation</li> <!-- Includes 1% for doing course evaluation. -->
            <li>35%: A substantial final project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on the number of students in class, we may adjust the relative
        grading portion of the class presentations versus paper reviews. In
        addition, since this is a seminar-style class, students will be expected
        to attend class, unless they have notified the instructor in advance.
        <b>You must inform the instructor regarding <i>every</i> absence</b>.
        Frequent absences will be handled on a case-by-case basis and will
        result in some grading penalty.</p>

        <br><p>Tentative grading scale, conditioned on adequate class attendance:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>[90, 100]: A</li>
            <li>[85,  90): A-</li>
            <li>[80,  85): B+</li>
            <li>Grades lower than this will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
        </ul>

        <p>The grading scale may change over the semester.</p>
    </section>

        <b>Learning Objectives</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>A better understanding of the current research frontiers in robot manipulation, and robot learning more broadly.</li>
          <li>Gain experience reading, understanding, analyzing, and debating papers from robotics venues.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Main conferences: CoRL, RSS, ICRA, IROS, ISRR, ISER, WAFR.</li>
            <li>Main journals: RA-L, T-RO, IJRR, AURO, Science Robotics.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Understand, implement, and experiment with state-of-the-art algorithms for the final project.</li>
          <li>Improve academic writing and presentation skills.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <b>Academic Integrity</b>
        <p>Discussing with other students at a high level is allowed, but you must write up your own paper reviews and write, prepare, and deliver your own class presentation (if these are done in groups, then you can discuss with your group members). For final projects, you must also acknowledge whether this is ongoing and concurrent research (and to what extent you will be implementing or working on class-related material), and whether you are re-using materials for another class.</p><br>

        <p>You are welcome to use whatever resources you need to best learn the material. In general, we agree with <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/fa2022/integrity.html">Jeff Erickson's citation policy</a>. For example:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>If you talked with a robotic manipulation researcher to help understand a technical concept, you must acknowledge that person.</ul>
          <li>If you used someone else's blog post as a background reference, you must cite it.</ul>
          <li>Using Generative AI is encouraged, but you must tell us how you use it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide templates for assignments where you must acknowledge the ingredients you used for your assignment and/or project.</p>

        <b>Accommodating Diverse Needs</b>
        <p>If you have a disability and need academic accommodations, please
        discuss any needs with me as soon as possible. I will work with you to
        ensure that your needs are met and that we are able to effectively
        achieve the educational goals of this course.  I hope that students with
        diverse backgrounds can all benefit from the course. If there is
        something I can do to make this course better achieve that objective,
        feel free to contact me with suggestions.</p>
